Titanic Dataset EDA report
1. Overview of the Titanic Dataset
    -Dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns.
    -Missing values handled for 'Age'(filled with median values) and 'Embarked' (filled with mode) columns.
2. Key Insights
    -Survival rates vary by passenger class, with first class having the highest survival rate(62%) and lowerer for third class(24%).
    -Majority of passengers embarked from Southampton (S) followed by Cherbourg (C) and Queenstown (Q).
    -Most passengers were adults, with a median age of 28 years.
3. Visualizations
    -Bar chart showing survival rates by passenger class.
    -Histogram of passenger ages.
    -Embarked port distribution
